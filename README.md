Time-Series-Datasets


All Datasets are taken from Kaggle.
First, I did some data exploration and data visualization, and then split the data into training and validation sets. 
Second, I used some time series models in order to forecast the data.
Forecasting Methods Used:
	-Naive
	-Simple Average
	-Moving Average
	-Simple Exponential Smoothing
	-Holt's Linear
	-Holt's Winter
	-ARIMA/SARIMA
